The effort relates to the intensity of sampling and therefore can assist in interpreting measures of completeness.,"`40 box traps deployed at even spacings along 4 parallel 100m transects placed 50m apart and visited at 6 hourly intervals over a 48 hour period`, `2 people occupying a bird hide for a period of 8 hours and undertaking a 30 minute count of species within the 150 degree field of view every 2 hours`, `A single baited camera trap station with motion sensor trigger, deployed for a period of 10 days and configured for detecting large fauna moving through a known traffic way`",http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Event,2022-05-29,recommended,,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/hc/terms/samplingEffortProtocol,not in ABCD,extension
