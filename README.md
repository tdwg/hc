# Humboldt Core Task Group
A TDWG Task Group of the Observations &amp; specimens Interest Group

## :arrow_upper_right: Current activity

[Guralnick et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.02942) introduced the Humboldt Core as a proof of concept in 2018. In **2021**, the [TDWG Humboldt Core Task Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/osr/humboldt-core/) was established to review how to best integrate the terms proposed in the original publication with existing standards and implementation schemas. In the context of sharing data using the **Darwin Core standard**, different types of inventories can be represented as **Events** with different nesting levels. Therefore, it was deemed appropriate to build a **DwC Extension** to include all Humboldt Core terms that capture the details of the inventory process.

The Task Group members revised all original terms from [Guralnik et al. 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.02942), reformulated definitions, and discarded or added new terms where needed. The latest version of the terms can be found in the [vocabulary folder](https://github.com/tdwg/hc/tree/main/vocabulary), we have also built a [Humboldt Extension Quick Reference Guide](<https://tdwg.github.io/hc/terms/>).

We are currently developing a [Humboldt Extension user guide](<https://tinyurl.com/humboldt-documentation>) and reaching out to the larger biodiversity community to test the extension with real-world case study datasets using a test instance of the GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT).

If you are interested, please join the mailing list to contact the group (http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-humboldt).
