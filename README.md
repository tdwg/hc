# Humboldt Extension Task Group
A TDWG Task Group of the Observations &amp; specimens Interest Group

## :arrow_upper_right: Current activity

[Guralnick et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.02942) introduced the Humboldt Core as a proof of concept in 2018. In **2021**, the [TDWG Humboldt Extension Task Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/osr/humboldt-extension/) was established to review how to best integrate the terms proposed in the original publication with existing standards and implementation schemas. In the context of sharing data using the **Darwin Core standard**, different types of inventories can be represented as **Events** with different nesting levels. Therefore, it was deemed appropriate to build a **DwC Extension** to include all Humboldt Extension terms that capture the details of the inventory process.

The Task Group members reviewed all original terms from [Guralnik et al. 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.02942), reformulated definitions, and discarded or added new terms where needed. The latest version of the terms can be found in the [vocabulary folder](https://github.com/tdwg/hc/tree/main/vocabulary). We have also built a [Humboldt Extension Quick Reference Guide](<https://tdwg.github.io/hc/terms/>).

We are currently developing a [Humboldt Extension user guide](<https://tinyurl.com/humboldt-documentation>), but see the GBIF summarised version [here](https://docs.gbif.org/survey-monitoring-quick-start/en/).

As of February 2024, the Humboldt Extension was ratified as a Darwin Core Event class extension (https://eco.tdwg.org/). Hence, the Task Group was closed, and the extension is now maintained by the Darwin Core Maintenance Group (https://www.tdwg.org/community/dwc/).
