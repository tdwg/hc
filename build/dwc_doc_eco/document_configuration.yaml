documentTitle: "Humboldt Extension Vocabulary List of Terms"

# Abstract of document writtein by authors.
abstract: The Humboldt Extension for Ecological Inventories provides a standardized vocabulary to 
  report key information about biodiversity inventories, checklists and surveys, maximizing the 
  usability and interoperability 
  of these data. This vocabulary is employed along with the Darwin Core (DwC) terms, effectively 
  broadening the scope of dwc:Event records by incorporating terms absent from the main DwC vocabulary. 
  Terms included in the extension are defined such that they can accommodate hierarchical data 
  structures allowing the representation of complex, highly nested survey designs, permitting the 
  computation of relative abundances of species. This document 
  lists all terms currently used in the vocabulary providing comments and examples of their usage 
  along with ancillary documents that provide guidance on the use and interpretation of terms and 
  the data structure needed to accommodate dwc:Event hierarchies frequently observed in ecological 
  inventories.
