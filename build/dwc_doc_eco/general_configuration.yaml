# If the document being generated is a list of terms document, these values will be
# set automatically when the process.py script is used to generate the machine-readable
# metadata for the vocabulary. They should not be set manually because they will just be
# overwritten.

# However, for non-list of terms documents, these values
# must be set manually here.
