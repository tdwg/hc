taxonCompletenessReported,Taxon Completeness Reported,Statement about whether the taxonomic completeness of the dwc:Event was assessed.,"This term is meant to alert users that the inventory was conducted in such a way that all of the target taxa (the combination of eco:targetTaxonomicScope and eco:excludedTaxonomicScope) should have been detectable if they were present during the dwc:Event. This term can provide data users with a qualitative measure of how comprehensively an area has been surveyed, which assists in interpreting species populations, areas of occupancy, inferring species absences, etc. This term is only relevant if the dwc:Event used restricted search or open search methods. If taxonomic completeness was assessed, the methods used or an explanation of the basis of the completeness should be stated in eco: taxonCompletenessProtocols. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary.",`not reported`; `reported complete`; `reported incomplete`,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,not in ABCD,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Event,,extension
hasNonTargetTaxa,Has Non-target Taxa,One or more dwc:Organisms of taxa outside the target taxonomic scope (the combination of eco:targetTaxonomicScope and eco:excludedTaxonomicScope) were detected and reported for this dwc:Event.,"This term is meant to alert users to the presence of non-target taxa (in some disciplines called “bycatch”) reported in this dwc:Event. This term is relevant only if a target taxonomic scope is declared. Taxonomic scope is based on the combination of eco:targetTaxonomicScope and eco:excludedTaxonomicScope. Examination of the taxonomic scope is needed in order to identify the non-target taxa. It should be possible to confirm the expectations by investigating the dwc:Occurrences in this dwc:Event and in its child dwc:Events (if available) or by exploring eco:nonTargetTaxa for this dwc:Event (if populated). The value of this term should be 'true' if dwc:Occurrences of taxa outside the taxonomic scope as defined at the time of the dwc:Event are reported, otherwise the value of this term should be 'false'.",`true`; `false`,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,not in ABCD,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Event,,extension
nonTargetTaxa,Non-target Taxa,A list (concatenated and separated) of taxa reported during the dwc:Event that are outside of the target taxonomic scope (the combination of eco:targetTaxonomicScope and eco:excludedTaxonomicScope).,This term is meant to allow the full list of taxa that are considered outside of the taxonomic scope and yet were reported in the dataset to be shared. This term is relevant only if a target taxonomic scope is declared and eco:hasNonTargetTaxa is ‘true’. Taxonomic scope is based on the combination of eco:targetTaxonomicScope and eco:excludedTaxonomicScope. Non-target taxa (in some disciplines called “bycatch”) can be reported at any taxonomic level. Recommended best practice is to separate multiple values in a list with space vertical bar space ( | ).,`Parabuteo unicinctus | Geranoaetus melanoleucus`; `Cetoniinae | Aclopinae | Cyclocephala modesta`,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,not in ABCD,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Event,,extension

This term is only relevant if the dwc:Event used restricted search or open search methods and if a target taxonomic scope is declared. Taxonomic scope is based on the combination of eco:targetTaxonomicScope and eco:excludedTaxonomicScope. Within dwc:Events that used either a restricted search or an open search method and declared a taxonomic scope, if all dwc:Organisms that are not included within the target taxonomic scope and that were detected during the dwc:Event were reported, the value of this term should be 'true', otherwise the value of this term should be false'.",`true`; `false`,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,not in ABCD,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Event,,extension

Organismal scope is based on the combination of all of the following terms: eco:targetLifeStageScope, eco:excludedLifeStageScope, eco:targetDegreeOfEstablishmentScope, eco:excludedDegreeOfEstablishmentScope, eco:targetGrowthFormScope, and eco:excludedGrowthFormScope. Examination of the organismal scope is needed in order to identify the non-target dwc:Organisms. It should be possible to confirm the expectations by investigating the dwc:Occurrences in this dwc:Event and in its child dwc:Events (if available).
