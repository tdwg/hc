# Humboldt Extension

NOTE: This document forms part of a proposal by the [Humboldt Core Task Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/osr/humboldt-core/) to extend Darwin Core with vocabulary for biological inventories. It is not yet ratified and may change as a result of recommendations received during the course of open public commentary. To help reviewers during the public comment period to understand how the extension was tested and what was learned from that testing, an [Implementation Experience Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RFdSHoyzWCQk9qO6uup4xQjWOMzPyBb-A0mcjj98hbk/edit?usp=sharing) is available.

The official submission for addition to Darwin Core includes the [list of terms](list/) and two guides that explain how the extension must be used ([isLeastSpecificTargetCategoryQuantityInclusive](inclusive/) and [hierarchical events](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r_XMEgB7p7OI7a5Ouq6G9oa7LmQFPcFhZZCLD9gWOIE/edit?usp=sharing) guidelines). The [Quick reference guide](terms/) and [Usage guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RFdSHoyzWCQk9qO6uup4xQjWOMzPyBb-A0mcjj98hbk/edit?usp=sharing) are not officially part of the addition to Darwin Core, but may provide a less technical point of entry to understanding the extension.

The Humboldt Extension is a standard vocabulary maintained by the [Darwin Core Maintenance Group](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/#maintenance%20group). It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to **facilitate the sharing of information about biological inventories.** by providing identifiers, labels, definitions, usage comments and examples.
