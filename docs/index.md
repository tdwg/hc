NOTE: This document forms part of a proposal by the [Humboldt Core Task Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/osr/humboldt-core/) to extend Darwin Core with vocabulary for ecological inventories. It is not yet ratified and may change as a result of recommendations received during the course of open public commentary. To help reviewers understand how the extension was tested and what was learned from that testing, an [Implementation Experience Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RFdSHoyzWCQk9qO6uup4xQjWOMzPyBb-A0mcjj98hbk/edit?usp=sharing) is available.

The official submission for addition to Darwin Core includes the [list of terms](list/) and two guides that explain how the extension must be used ([isLeastSpecificTargetCategoryQuantityInclusive](inclusive/) and [hierarchical events](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r_XMEgB7p7OI7a5Ouq6G9oa7LmQFPcFhZZCLD9gWOIE/edit?usp=sharing) guidelines). The [Quick reference guide](terms/) and [Usage guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rX4m94rtZDR_8iIe3RvRnNYKDJcmSX3ii4S5hCznEA0/edit?usp=sharing) are not officially part of the addition to Darwin Core, but may provide a less technical point of entry to understanding the extension.

The Humboldt Extension for Ecological Inventories is a standard vocabulary maintained by the [Darwin Core Maintenance Group](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/#maintenance%20group). It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to **facilitate the sharing of information about ecological inventories** by providing identifiers, labels, definitions, usage comments and examples.
