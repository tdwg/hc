# Humboldt Extension

NOTE: This document forms part of a proposal by the [Humboldt Core Task Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/osr/humboldt-core/) to extend Darwin Core with vocabulary for biological inventories. It is not yet ratified and may change as a result of recommendations received during the course of open public commentary.

The Humboldt Extension is a standard vocabulary maintained by the [Darwin Core Maintenance Group](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/#maintenance%20group). It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to **facilitate the sharing of information about biological inventories.** by providing identifiers, labels, definitions, usage comments and examples.
