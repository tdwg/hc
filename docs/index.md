title: Humboldt Extension for Ecological Inventories
description: The Humboldt Extension for Ecological Inventories is a vocabulary for transmitting information about biodiversity surveys with hierarchical structure. It is used along with Darwin Core terms to extend descriptions of Events.

NOTE: This document forms part of a proposal by the [Humboldt Extension Task Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/osr/humboldt-extension/) to extend Darwin Core with vocabulary for ecological inventories. It is not yet ratified. To help readers understand how the extension was tested and what was learned from that testing, an [Implementation Experience Report](humboldt_extension_implementation_experience_report.pdf) is available.

The official submission for addition to [Darwin Core](http://www.tdwg.org/standards/450) includes the [list of terms](list/), a [list of controlled vocabulary terms](tcr/) for the property `eco:taxonCompletenessReported`, and two guides that explain how the extension must be used ([isLeastSpecificTargetCategoryQuantityInclusive](inclusive/) and [hierarchical events](hierarchy/) guidelines). The [Quick reference guide](terms/) and [Usage guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rX4m94rtZDR_8iIe3RvRnNYKDJcmSX3ii4S5hCznEA0/edit?usp=sharing) are not officially part of the addition to Darwin Core, but may provide a less technical point of entry to understanding the extension.

The Humboldt Extension for Ecological Inventories is a standard vocabulary maintained by the [Darwin Core Maintenance Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/dwc/). It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to **facilitate the sharing of information about ecological inventories** by providing identifiers, labels, definitions, usage comments and examples.
